this attempts to port the following revision of pytorctl
(git://git.torproject.org/git/pytorctl):

-----------
commit 93f0f625e5deab79002dac2d39a4ea3ecaaa2f8e
Author: Mike Perry <mikeperry-git@fscked.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 6 12:58:07 2010 -0800

    Add some minimal support for extrainfo documents.
-----------

in the pytorctl, the "sorted_r" list is passed around and used copies
being made, so changes to the list (i.e., order of the routers in the
list) in one place will reflect in all other places. (the elements
themselves are pointers, which our cpp already mirrors the behavior.)

so, in cpptorctl, we also pass the sorted_r around as pointer. NOT yet
tested.

dependencies (on ubuntu 11.04):
  liblog4cxx10-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev
